# 👋 Hallo, I'm Sahil Jasani  

### 🚀 Industrial Automation & AI Control Engineer  
🔹 Mechatronics Engineer | Intelligent Control Systems | IIoT & Edge AI  
🔹 Currently: Master’s Thesis @ **Festo SE & Co. KG** → *Hybrid MPC + AI for Bioreactors*  
🔹 Location: Esslingen, Germany 🇩🇪 | Open to relocation (yes, I can handle German winters ❄️)

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I build **control systems that don’t panic** when things get nonlinear.  
Think of me as the guy who teaches machines to stay calm — whether it’s a bioreactor at Festo, a robot arm, or a noisy IIoT motor.  

Currently, I’m working on a **Hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC)** system with a dash of AI — because why choose between mathematics and machine learning when you can have both?
